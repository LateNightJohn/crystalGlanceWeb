the Galaxy, it's also a mirror of the Internet population as of today: most of the sentence is in English but you can find bits in German, Polish, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and other languages I could not even recognize, so it's global all right but not only, the content of the Sentence itself gives a very good sociological view of Net users: as Technical Conceptor Gary Welz puts it "In some sense we can regard the Sentence as a snapshot of the Internet community at the present time - widely dispersed, fascinated with the new technology, rabidly vocal, recklessly adolescent and shamelessly uncontrolled" many contributors are writing about themselves, putting links to their own pages, plenty are playing with the technical possibilities of HTML writing to put bold, big characters into the Sentence to break its monotony, some are writing off their phantasms as they would on a graffiti wall, many are taking this Sentence as a game and take up the challenge of writing on and on what goes through their mind just to be part of history; because this sentence is now part of history, ever since its conceptor, writer and first generation video artist (back in the late 60's) Douglas Davis started it on the net in early December 94 "Actually it was meant to stay there until February 15, 95 but the Sentence was already doing three miles long at that time and I just felt it did not belong to me anymore, when I started, I wanted to shock the world with its own brilliance and involvement with serious issues of communication, expression, art, literature, and even grammar"  insists Davis, "not so much on the megalomaniac side of net users"; so it goes on and on, in June alone, the Host computer of the Sentence recorded more than 50,000 hits, it's impossible to know how many people made a contribution to the Sentence, but Douglas Davis guesses that it goes into "thousands of people", and it will grow even more, especially in Asia, since the Sentence is one of the attraction of the Kwangju Biennale in Korea which is held in mid-september, one of the contributor, Eugene Schwartz, who is a famous collector of Contemporary art, a long time admirer of Douglas's work and has purchased many works Douglas did, even bought a disc with the sentence, the pictures, the sound and the video thst are included in the sentence for an undisclosed amount of money but anyway money is not the problem here, what counts is that this World First and Longest Collaborative Sentence clearly means on the net the birth of a new "period" ;-{)}</p><p>





  and I do hope that the Sentence Isn't done and even if it is no one will read my 

silly little SUBmission because i'm way far down here - far from the bits I left up 

Town- and I just want to share something that I discovered today and that is that's 

its impossiblr to live in the NOW, even if we had a cosmic radio announcer who said 

AT THE TONE IT IS NOW BEEEEEEP there would be now in the beginning of the beeeep and

a now in the middle and at the end and by the time the beeep was in your ears it 

wouldn't even be NOW anymore it would be THEN and just thinking about how we're 

all actually livivng in the THEN is a bit strange but not AS strange as the fact that 

this is probably a veritable COMPENDIUM of CORNINESS with all the corny things a lot

of people but most certainly not ALL wanted to say and make it sound deep or cool

or neo-way-out-beatnik, even though the last beatnik wasted away I think which is 

sad because I always wanted to meet one and I wonder if I put my address on this wou;d

anyone even notice not as though I'm going to after all I'm not some chic chick 

out for a kinky stalker to add flavor (vanilla or otherwise) to my life and now I

think its time for me to GO TO BED so GOOD NIGHT AMERICA SLEEP WELL AND SWEET 

VERY OH SO SWEET DREAMS and i wish i were in love with someone don't you   it's not easy being me <title>This is a test I'd be willing to bet that it will not show up</title>

</p><center><h1> YOU WERE RIGHT, YOUR STUPID TEST JAMMED THE SENTENCE FOR SO MANY WEEKS, DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART, SMARTASS?<p> WELL HERE IS THE REST OF THE SENTENCE AS PEOPLE POSTED IT WITHOUT NOTICING THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN ON THE SENTENCE BECAUSE A LITTLE BRAT DID A SO-CALLED "TEST" WHICH CONSISTED ON PLACING A "TITLE" COMMAND INSIDE HIS POSTING WITHOUT PURPOSLY PUTTING A "/TITLE" COMMAND LATER, SO WHATEVER WAS INTENDED TO BE POSTED LATER BY ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTORS JUST ENDED UP IN THE "TITLE" -  THAT'S WHY NOBODY AS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY ON THIS COOL WEB EXPERIMENT</p><p>  ANYWAY, I (ANONYMOUS) FOUND OUT THE PROBLEM AND GOT IT CORRECTED SO PLEASE CARRY ON WRITING</p><p>

BECAUSE I FIND IT SAD THAT ALL THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE SENTENCE AFTER THE LITTLE BRAT EXPERIMENT DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR PROSE IN THE SENTENCE, HERE IS A REPOST STARTING AT THE EXACT POINT WHERE THE LITTLE BRATEXPERIMENTED HIS DIRTY LITTLE TRICK </p></h1></center>


 Ahhh the fishes have tales to tell and stuff to show 


we must be part of this its in our gills they tell us so green and a half worms of August and well, it's past the date all of you said but you never said we couldn't ANYWAY so here's a fragment for you, just a little piece of my illusions for your very own, new and improved, half the fat, calories, and assorted little furry creatures that live in dark places and don't come out much, except to use the bathrooms, which of course they haven't -got- anyway in the little dark places where the furry things live, but my little fragment that i'm giving you has -half- of them now, for your very own, ever and always, and you can even show it to your grandchildren and say I Was There When, you see, but you can't have ANY MORE OF ME, damn you all, so don't ask

understand in reality which is an oxymoron anyways what it could by any means mean the goal is to give love after all, if I can cheat death and get more than my fifteen seconds of fame I'm happy; I just hope this isn't it, or was that minutes; oh it doesn't matter - we'll never get it anyway; what? what?

and outside the whipped dogs whimper in the alley while broken children cherish
broken dreams; i wandered past the shattered husks of former health as they lay 
in the alley and glanced at a hooker on her knees paying off a cop in trade; 
stevie and i had arranged the meet, and i was hungry for the money and it seemed
that the vials were burning where they lay against my leg; but when they caught me
slipping them into my mouth to do a handoff to stevie by kissing him long and deep, 
passing him the vial with my tongue, pretending not to notice the feel of his tongue
against mine, pretending i couldn't taste his fetid breath; then they took me down to 
the station and worked me over until they were bored then tossed me in with the drag
queens;

there was one, who called herself "jackie o'nasty" and she was in for stabbing a man;
i asked her why she did it;
<p>
she said "well, there we were, my man and i walking along on our way over
to Pierre's -- you know that bar over there by the cinema near the Zone -- and
we were on our way over there even though the acts there are really nothing 
compared to what they used to be when Miss Virginia Ham was lip synching there, i mean,
the kids today just don't have it; when i was first coming into drag, i made my
own outfits and it was all a craft, an art; today these young kids just buy
their own; and i just *don't* want to know <em>where</em> they get the money;
probably into drugs; i never made that kind of money when i was hooking; but the
whole management thing got on my nerves so i just left that bad boy in the dust
and went freelance and started flagging down truckers, standing on the corner and 
waving at them; and i know i'm not looking mighty real now, since the cops tore
my outfit like this (those brutes) but i was looking so very real that most
of those phobic good old boys never knew that i give good head because a girl like
me knows what a man like him wants;</p><p>
"but anyways, i was explaining how i got here; so there we were walking over to Pierre's Bar
and my man is wearing his stonewall 25 gay pride t-shirt that we got at the dance on 
the USS Independence and suddenly these two cute adorable college boys in their frat 
shirts start hollering at us, calling my man a fag-boy; well, we ignored them, after 
all, a lady has her dignity; but they started following us and calling out the most
dreadful things to us; and just as we were getting close to the busy part of the
street, they ran up behind us and knocked him down and asked why i was hanging out
with a fag-boy like that; and, well, i may not look it now, but i was a wrestler
in high school and i used to box until i realized that i just couldn't cut it as
a butch boy; so i decked the one closest to me and when the other one pulled a 
knife, i just took it away from him and slapped him upside the head so very hard
that it knocked him out cold; the first one had gotten up by this time and was
running back over to me with hatred in his eyes, but i knocked him out too; after all, a 
girl has to protect her man, doesn't she, now; but that's what the cops couldn't understand
about it because when they showed up they were nice and friendly until they realized that
i wasn't a real girl, and it's just a little piece of flesh but it upset them mightily;
and so they took me in and worked me over and that's why i'm here,"</p><p>
i looked her up and down and realized that that she-male was ballsier than i would've been
in that situation; so i let her live even though she had seen my face;</p><p>
everyone else in the station who had seen me wasn't so lucky; including the old secretary 
who was filing my mug shot;</p><p>
i was out on the street again and dreaming of my home among the fellow water-mammals; 
sometimes, it was tough to be a were-human; sometimes i wished i was just a dolphin
like my siblings and pod-mates;
</p><hr>
  
<hr>
i dreamed of a !kung tribesman roaming the urban jungle, and of a
stone-faced urban homeboy roving the african continent; i dreamed of
lovers calling out in passion, and the cold chill that follows hearing
someone call out a name that isn't yours as you grunt and scream your
way to an aborted climax; i dreamed of the children in the gutters,
calling out for a piece of bread, selling their bodies to those who
slice the flesh from their bones trying to make contact with someone,
<em>anyone</em>; i dreamed of butchers in dachau deboning live women
and the men who volunteered for "aviation" experiments where they were
left in icy water (simulating a pilot stranded in the atlantic) until
they died, or who were placed in atmospheric chambers that were
evacuated until they died from lack of oxygen or from the lack of
atmosphere; i dreamed of whipped dogs whimpering in the night; i
dreamed of bondage in a microgravity environment and it was the most
erotic dream of my life as a man was tied and sodomized and then i
stood in front of him and slid his member into my vagina and rode him
in the spinning no-end-up world of orbit until we both screamed; i
dreamed i knew the reason cats scream in the night like children and
angels are never seen in the alleys occupied by hookers on their knees
paying off cops drunk on power; i dreamed i saw the naked face of love
and it was scarred with experience; i dreamed i saw innocence lost and
the terror of knowing what's going to happen next; 
<p>
i sit in the hospital waiting room, blood flowing freely from my
skull; it drips into my eyes and i shake my head, spattering the walls
with red; a family huddles together across the room, muttering in a
language unknown; 
</p><p>

�Sentir�s V�rtigo!, dice mi alma 


Vino a buscar su muerte, grita mi imaginaci�n 





Ya no te tranquilizar� la paranoia que me acosa;


tampoco emprender� el vuelo dejando algo para regresar 





El:


�Regresa!, aunque sea a burlarte de m�.


�L�cete!, del�itame con tus majestuosas alas,


sac�delas y d�jame observar los mil destellos de tus plumas 





�Altiva! muestra tu bello cuerpo, su perfecci�n divina,


�Cuantas personas habr�s maravillado? 





�P�rfida!, he amado la soledad porque tu maldad es regocijante 


Tu mundo es et�reo, lo cambias seg�n tus intereses 





�Exijo que regreses! porque ya no eres libre 


Ahora eres m�a, me perteneces, �Nunca podr�s liberarte 


porque desde hoy, mi coraz�n tiene tu esencia 





Orgulloso puedo levantar el rostro y mirar hacia arriba,


mirarte a los ojos y disfrutar tus labios, sentir como te consumes


con bocanadas de aire esforz�ndote por huir 





Princesa es imposible escapar de los sue�os, 


recuerda, el que duerme soy yo

or strange, and they think they are revealing some all 
encompassing knowledge or worldly truth when all they really
know about is their own tiny micro world, and they get some 
cheep thrill out of this pseudo-vouyerism and an even more
perverted high from the knowledge that other vouyers are 
reading their stupid shit, all these people think they are a
part of some huge global community when all they really are 
is a group of lost individuals who think they know who they 
are, they can't see that this world is but a prison, filled
with simple toys to keep our minds off of the shit beneath,
they struggle to forget, to erase the true world from their 
memory, and many do, living a lie in a world they created 
for themselves from their own imagination, and now they are
stuck in that fucking limbo of false happiness frolicking in
their own shit,                                             

But I am not as synical as I seem, because I search for a
light, some hope that things can be different, and I have
tried, tried fucking hard in fact to change my world or to 
have it change me, but nothing works, and I go on, and maybe
one day I will triumph but probably not because we are all 
fooled by those simple toys and I eventually will stop to 
play, and when that happens I will have lost my way, all my
progress erased, and my one true hope gone forever,

Please dont leave me hope, I may be imperfect in every way
but I am still trying to get through, to reach my apex of
reality, and I will not let you fucking beat me, I will not 
stop and play, I will win, I will find life, I will find 
love, I will find peace in my world and then I will tell all
those lost souls what you have held from them, just wait
and see,

and to the vouyers, I know this was a rather sloppy, 
gramatically incorrect passage lacking some continuity of
thought but please don't hold that against my message, it 
was as true to me as I could possibly make it,

and finally to hope, look for me in the near future, I'll be
knockin', you better answer

I'm a French journalist living in Japan, I wrote an article to present  the World First Collaborative Sentence in a Japanese monthly called "Nikkei Click", to respect the spirit of the sentence, I managed to write this article without using a single period either in English nor in Japanese so I figured it was eligible inside the sentence itself; here is the english version, click on it to reach my home-page from where you can read the japanese version of the article, very interesting comments from Douglas Davis (the conceptor of the Sentence) and from Gary Welz (who cleared the technical aspects of this site) or other articles I wrote to present the web </font></p><p><font size="4">

Is there a point at writing a sentence without one was the question I asked myself when I looked at "The World First (and Longest) Collaborative Sentence" a few days ago: this sentence goes on and on, upon more than 300 K, and without a single period in it (actually there is because hackers found a way to force periods into the program), but it is not only the longest sentence on this side of the Galaxy, it's also a mirror of the Internet population as of today: most of the sentence is in English but you can find bits in German, Polish, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and other languages I could not even recognize, so it's global all right but not only, the content of the Sentence itself gives a very good sociological view of Net users: as Technical Conceptor Gary Welz puts it "In some sense we can regard the Sentence as a snapshot of the Internet community at the present time - widely dispersed, fascinated with the new technology, rabidly vocal, recklessly adolescent and shamelessly uncontrolled" many contributors are writing about themselves, putting links to their own pages, plenty are playing with the technical possibilities of HTML writing to put bold, big characters into the Sentence to break its monotony, some are writing off their phantasms as they would on a graffiti wall, many are taking this Sentence as a game and take up the challenge of writing on and on what goes through their mind just to be part of history; because this sentence is now part of history, ever since its conceptor, writer and first generation video artist (back in the late 60's) Douglas Davis started it on the net in early December 94 "Actually it was meant to stay there until February 15, 95 but the Sentence was already doing three miles long at that time and I just felt it did not belong to me anymore, when I started, I wanted to shock the world with its own brilliance and involvement with serious issues of communication, expression, art, literature, and even grammar"  insists Davis, "not so much on the megalomaniac side of net users"; so it goes on and on, in June alone, the Host computer of the Sentence recorded more than 50,000 hits, it's impossible to know how many people made a contribution to the Sentence, but Douglas Davis guesses that it goes into "thousands of people", and it will grow even more, especially in Asia, since the Sentence is one of the attraction of the Kwangju Biennale in Korea which is held in mid-september, one of the contributor, Eugene Schwartz, who is a famous collector of Contemporary art, a long time admirer of Douglas's work and has purchased many works Douglas did, even bought a disc with the sentence, the pictures, the sound and the video that are included in the sentence for an undisclosed amount of money but anyway money is not the problem here, what counts is that this World First and Longest Collaborative Sentence clearly means on the net the birth of a new "period" ;-{)}</font></p></a><p><a href="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~etienne"><font size="5">

It's late and I want to sleep, I need to sleep, sleep would be great but I sit here and debate about my actions but I'm not a famous person, nor do I claim to be the phsycho that haunts the dreams that you dream, your dream that is going nowhere just like this plane in my mind, it keeps circling, looking for a landing strip but there isn't one in sight because this isn't where we all should be, on a plain, dreaming the night away in out nice soft beds with dreams dance in our heads, the dreams linger as the sun comes up, the moon is gone and so are the wishes and dreams that once inhabited the vast plain in our minds, now it's time to work, work as hard as we can so we can hurry up and die, an eternal, never ending dream, a tale that will never be told until the listeners already know the secret that has been kept for so long, as long ago as the first human has this secret been kept, it will be kept for ages to come, and infinite time this secret will be kept, told only to the keepers themselves, does the dream last forever I ask myself, does it only last a split second before we are forced to dream no more I ask myself, what if there are no more dreams, what if all that is left is an eternal nothing that lasts forever, never giving up, never releasing it's grasp until time ends, then what happens I ask myself, if there is no time to have dreams, and no dreamers to dream, then what happens to everything that the was worked so hard for I ask myself, it will simply be gone and all the efforts that were put into creating such a wonderful (or not) thing will be gone, will we have another chance to do it all over again, will we be able to regain what we have so suddenly lost, or will the never be another dream, now I dream, maybe for the last time, maybe for the first, I dream away in my nice soft bed while I drift off to another world

 are you still there, can you hear me I am impatient and lust for periods, periods, question marks - how 
long canshould this go on? 

Jasper says: it should go on until we all get so utterly bored that nobody is posting -- clearly that is not happening yet -- not much to comment on at this point, since I don't read French -- why should I want to?  I went to France and they were all rude to me -- there is one country that lives up to their stereotype -- the only country that seems to be ruder to foreigners is my own -- the United States of weaponry, hungrily broiling a cat in the secretions of Sharon Stone, you 
get the feeling there's someone looking you up and down through a 
rifle scope, so It's a fact that I don't writte English and I don't read English but It's 

live, most people on this sentence speak English, sometimes French, Spanish, 

Indi, Dutch, --- this sentence maybe become a babel tower with 

segments undertstable for some people only Is that a problem ????? 

(Est-ce un probleme ?) I don't know (je ne sai pas) For the moment the sentence 

go on till the sentence go on The problem is that Biological 

time series where the same pattern of activity repeated at irregular time 

intervals partitioned into several typical lenghts, each corresponding to a 

defined symbol--------evaluation of the order of the sequence obtained  from 

brain recordings leads to unexpected high values remarkedly correlated

with apparent and noapparent randomness Following of the high attractors 

dimension such strong correlation have important physiological states of chaotic 

dynamics in brain leads to chaotic information processing in the brain like 

a nonsense sentence like this one Following the embedding wavelet space 

reconstructed with recorded experiments cut up thoughs from an assembly of codes

set into the flow of autosomilaring structures informated decephering the 

other codes but what is a code like such a sentence ?????? but we, jane and i, add to the twfcs with these simple words 'be nice and

love one another, both animate and inanimate, for all things are connected

as these bits are connected; not to do so is to byte the Taoist hand that

orchistrates all things with the exception of itself; of itself it knows

not of itself Think of it, the atoms that first joined with other atoms to form living,

self replicating molecules are still among us, perhaps part of you and

a part of me, and if not currently those very atoms, then certainly

their knowledge of helical propigation that is always self referencing and so we try again and again to make this work hello to jane bell from korea please call or fax to david ross and bill anastssi and tell them it is now time to speak about gene schwhwwartz on this sentence love from douglas <p> Jasper says: I suppose I must now apologize for my rave about France -- I'm sorry, but it's just another one my raves against people who have been mean to me: I suppose I should be used to it by now, however -- being short and ugly in our shallow society, I get it all the time --  that things about "Biological time series," what was that?  I mean, it sounds like an episode of Star Trek when everything is solved by using "science" that is all made up and that nobody understands anyway -- is that Drama?  I don't think so!  The "be nice and love one another" advice is nice and sweet, but hey, who the hell is listening to that?  Nobody -- we all treat each other like crap -- as for the personal greetings, I don't know what to say, other than I have none of my own -- I've been too alienated by my fellow humans to greet any of them (at least this evening) -- well, that's my current rant (much less nationalistic too) </p><p> I found a great quote from Thomas Paine, famous American something or other...

"When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virture is not hereditary."

What would this 18th century statesman think of this quote in the context of the internet? is this the end of everything  but here I am in Kwangju and it works hello from korea again to jane and to the world douglas on tuesday The sentence will go on until it stops and D* K* says : there aren't any differences between Science and 

Drama Both can be seen as Science or Drama, This is a question of point of view ~~~ For exemple

when Galliliee said "The earth turns" he could say "I love the good armchairs", or "Als Beispiel fur

erregbare Medien wird dann das FitzHughNagumo Modell untersucht", but he said "the earth turns" !

It was essentially a dramatic effect; another exemple : Caesar said in "Cesar the imperator" :

"I think I am the master of the world", it was an unbiassed fact, but he could also say : "I am dry",

"I never read, I just look at pictures" or "The earth turns" ! So the distinctions between Drama 

and Science are illusions, and "Biological Times Series" don't need such a qualification with

his near understable expressions with "scientific" concepts extracted from their usual 

contexts--- I haven't to explain what is a Biological Time series  or Wavelets because what we

call "explanation" is only a tendency of our brains to react to stimulus in front of the

information in memory, an "explanation" is a cultural motor output of our mouths and tongues or fingers,

a problem of pronounciation and I dislike gymnastic~~~ I have no explanations to give you 

I should shut up but I don't~~~ If you begin to play with your fingers it's difficult to stop ---

to be true because i like reading but maybe this is all there is and i'll

always just be sitting at a computer monitor writing about the fact that

is raining outside and how i don't understand une grue vient de s'ecraser sur une ligne de chemin de fer et c'est 

particulierement chiant, je disais juste ca comme ca pour passer le

temps en attendant de me decider a rentrer chez moi en stop et ca 

va durer durer durer avant qu'on me ramasse pauvre de moi pour

me ramener chez moi parce qu'une saloperie de grue est tombee

et bloque le train qui devait ramener chez moi, pourquoi tant de 

vent ici et de pluie alors que je vai rentrer chez moi en stop 

c'est une situation de merde et tout ces gens en voiture qui ne 

vont meme pas me regarder alors que je voudrai etre au sec je les

hais a l'avance juste pour marquer le coup et leur donner ma 

facon de penser dont il se foute comme de leur premiere sucette alors 

que moi je doit subir les effets nefaste de cette chute de grue qui

aurait mieux fait de leur tombe dessu sur eux et leur voitures

 <p>Jasper says: Well, woo-eee!  A lot has happened since my last commentary, but I'll keep this one short: i've found I haven't the brain, heart, or guts to do this commentary by myself, so I'd like to introduce my spruce companian Google -- now, Jasper's commentary will become the Jasper/Google dialoges!  Who is Google?  I have no idea, but I would like Google to be YOU: yes, you -- simply respond by saying "Google says" or something to that effect, and we can go back and forth in commentary as the sentence progresses -- so, what say you, Google?  Are drama and science the same?  How about all that "#@%@#%$$?%@$" nonsense?  How about the lonely fella sitting in front of his computer screen while it rains?  What sayest Google to all this? </p><p> --------------------

	As I waded through this long string of text labeled 'The World's first collabrative sentence,

I began to wonder -- mostly about the individuals behind each post -- the hurt souls,

the blind, hypocrites, the angry, tense screamers; I wondered about them all	

and I can't grasp what I'm thinking -- but man, the man who screams and shouts

at fools who can't percieve a world of good, of a world of sick toys and morons

festering in their own waste --  grow up!  Shed your hipocrosy!  Your cynicism

is hateful -- your message one of melodrama

I just thought I�d do that... thank you very much...____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\

it�s me...Chris Amos...again..._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Oh, great... now I feel guilty... I have blemished this sacred sector of cyberspace... no one will ever know the kind of guilt I feel right now... I am trult sorry, Mr. Davis, for making your creation not quite as beautiful as it could have bee... of all the things I do in my entire life, will this be the one thing that remains when I am gone? ----THIS LONGEST SENTENCE IN THE WORLD IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE FRIENDLY PEOPLE AT BLAMO COLA, "SLAM A BLAMO"----- and now . . . my 3 seconds of fame is realized <size=4>Martha's Ox is Under the Moon and i say,

it is midnight / the rain is beating on the windows / I am in my mother's room /

it is midnight / the rain beating on the windows / and I am in my mother's room /

it's I who loves there now / it's I lives there now / I don't know how I got there /

perhaps in an ambulance, certainly a vehicle of some kind / perhaps in an ambulance, certainly /

a vehicle of some kind / I was helped / I'd never have got there alone / I was helped /

there's this man who comes every week / perhaps I got there thanks to him / he says not /

he gives me money / yes, I work now, a little like I used to, except that ... I don't know how to work anymore /

yes ... I work now, like I used to, a little, except anymore I don't know how to work /

that doens't matter, apparently / what I'd like now is to speak of the things that are left, say my goodbyes, finish dying /

what I'd like now is to speak / the things that are left / say goodbye / finish dying / the truth is, I haven't much will left /

for what? I don't know / the truth is, I don't know much / for example, my mother's death /

for example / my mother's death / was she already dead when I came? or did she only die later? I mean, enough to bury /

I don't know / perhaps they haven't buried her yet / perhaps they haven't / buried her /

yet / I don't know / in any case, I have her room / I sleep in her bed / I have taken her place /

I must resemble her more and more / all I need now is a son / perhaps I have one somewhere /

I think not, I think not / that doesn't matter, apparently � good /

he. the one who comes to see me, he's a queer one / it was he told me I'd begun all wrong / begun / all wrong / that I should have begun differently /

I don't know / I don't know I don't know / he must be right / I began at the beginning, can you imagine that? I began at the beginning /

here's my beginning / I took a lot of trouble with it / here it is / it gave me a lot of trouble /

it was the beginning, do you understand? whereas now, it's nearly the end /

is what I do now ... any better? I don't know / that's beside the point /

here's my beginning / it must mean something

 ============================================================

This project started out as a critical analysis of modern 

news media and the New York Times newspaper. The original 

idea was to explore the way meanings were created by the 

New York Times through the use of language, image and format.

However, I became very interested in creating something that 

had a life, something that was out in the world, and something

that offered a solution to the way that I felt that modern 

news media were shaping the identity of the planet. This shift

in interest became apparent when I moved beyond a formal 

analysis of the New York Times and began to come to understand 

the deeper function of the newspaper and the problems involved 

with this aspect of the newspaper. I began to see the newspaper

as an object that had come to serve a function as a definer 

of social realities. We all look to the newspaper to come to 

understand the accepted behaviors, the social structure, and 

the limits of our position in our society. These functions 

were once the responsibility of the tribal shaman, the priest,

the bible etc. Today, we must rely upon the mega-corporations, 

which produce and control news media, to fulfill this sacred task 

and this realization is what inspired my senior project. It

was my intention to produce an online newspaper that would 

offer a more humanistic, and thus more realistic, picture of

our social reality by allowing each person the ability to

submit there own news stories. The form of this online news

paper was an adaptation of earlier studies of the construction 

of meanings in which I took the contents of the New York Times 

and fused it with the vernacular of some common consumer products. 

It was an attempt to show very directly how I felt about the 

New York Times and its role as a consumer product owned by news 

conglomerates. It was my intention at the beginning of this 

project to comment on the connections and conflicts I found between

the production of unbiased news and the running of a business, 

but decided to reach further down inside the various levels of 

functions, of modern newspapers, to the social reality issue. 

It was my intention to offer a solution to the problems that 

I uncovered and the internet was the medium that offered me 

that chance. It is a place where I can have my voice, were I have

the power to invent and reinvent who I am or what I think, on a

daily basis. In an overmediated world in which the rich and powerful

are the only ones with the ability to have a voice, the internet

stands alone as the only mass medium to which the �people� have access. 

My newspaper will continue to change and evolve as time passes, 

and therein lies its beauty. It is a piece that has a life, 

that allows you a voice.

His was sore.

It seemed needless, wanton, but he put his friend between himself and the butter so the star worms would have something to do on a Saturday night.  My mother

asked about you during the yellow thunderstorm, but my God!  You were nowhere -- everywhere.

I sat upright in the bed and turned the pages of my screwdriver.  There was nothing but elephants talking in circles, complaining

about this, that, etc.  We spat into our shoes and sang songs to the grass.  I hammered away at the photons with my eyes coupled to a shopping bag, but to no avail.

Why has this bread left me hanging?  Where is the jelly?  I rang the gong for a thirty-fifth time but Hovan failed to appear,

just as he had failed to appear right there the day before.  I masked my anger with my wings and sharpened my claws on the horns of

my gargoyle.  Little chips of paint fell upward to the floor where I'd put the handles of my trunk.

Hubris, it was, or Jell-O.  I sang a song about Feta cheese and they took my bazooka away.

Nevermind, I am tired of these games and the scores they keep about me in the Big Book of Little Things.

Tiny goldenrod spurs floated into my nose just as I was painting it over to keep things out of my nostrils.  I sneezed in my imagination and

thought I saw a fracture of lightning pass across my eyelids just before I lost

consciousness. into absolute unknown with white wine and friend by side we wonder where from and to where this missive into the white void goes, do question marks count? -- $5 per .5 hr at the @cafe on St. mark's place -- we wish we knew what had come before; our verbal ancestry in this sentence, the context, the flow, if any, of ideas ... how many of our fragments end with"................"??????????------ keep the ball moving! don't let it drop! but, seriously, we think you should consider this suggestion: show what's already been written, or at least what is immediate before the current blank white canvas/screen--You know?
